Assignment – IV
(All programs to be implemented in C)

Topic : Single linked list
1. Write a C program to reverse an already created single linked list.
Mention the necessary algorithm.        
2. Write a C program to merge two already sorted list.  
Mention the necessary algorithm.
3. Given a singly linked list of size N. The task is to left-shift the linked list by k nodes, where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to length of the linked list.
4. Write a C program to perform addition of two polynomials using linked list.
5. Given a singly linked list of size N. The task is to swap elements in the linked list pairwise. For example, if the input list is 1 2 3 4, the resulting list after swaps will be 2 1 4 3. 
6. Write a C program to detect a loop in a single linked list.
7. Write a C program to perform multiplication of two polynomials using linked list.
8. Write a C program to implement the concept of stack using single linked list.
9. Write a C program to implement the concept of queue using single linked list.
