Topic : Double linked list
1. Write a C program to create a Double linked list along with the following functions:
   a) to display the elements of a Double Linked List.
   b) to add an element at beginning of a Double linked list.
   c) to add an element at the end of a Double linked list.
   d) to add an element at any user given position of a Double linked list.
   e) to search a user given element in a Double linked list.
   f) to count the number of nodes in a Double linked list.
   g) to delete a node at beginning of a Double linked list.
   h) to delete a node at end of a Double linked list.
   i) to delete a node from any position of a Double linked list.
(Create a menu bar using switch case statement in the main)
Mention the necessary algorithm.
